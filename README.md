# FreefitClubsLocations

Using the [Freefit](https://freefit.co.il/) website to pull all clubs and create a CSV file that includes all the club's points with the club name and URL. 
The CSV file is in the format that [Google My Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/d/mp?hl=en&authuser=0&state=create) expected, just needed to [upload](https://support.google.com/mymaps/answer/3024836/) it to the map to see all the points :)

You can use the [CSV](https://github.com/lironbenyeda/FreefitClubsLocations/blob/main/map.csv) that created on 17-July-2021.
